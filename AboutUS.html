                      energy appliances and technologies?
                </p>
                <p id="ans-one">You can apply by filing Form 5695 with tax to claim your tax credits. 
                You can be eligible to claim it after installing the renewable energy system, 
                not during purchase.

                <p id="q-two">How long does it take to recoup investments in renewable energy?
                </p>
                <p id="ans-two">To recoup investments in renewable energy systems usually 
                takes an average of six to ten years which is dependent on various factors.

                <p id="q-3">How affordable is renewable energy compared to investing in non-renewable 
                        energy?
                </p>
                <p id="ans-three">According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, In 2022 
                        the price of renewable sources of energy such as solar photovoltaic energy 
                        cost $0.0636 per kWh while fossil fuels cost $0.2691 per kWh. Through the 
                        years, the cost of renewable is drastically dropping. Also investing in renewable 
                        energy allows for various benefits without any external cost unlike non-renewable 
                        energy which could cause environmental damage, property damage, and  health problems. 
                        Renewable energy is expected to  have an amazing payback as well!

                <p id="q-four">What is the process for installing residential solar panels or any other 
                renewable energy system?
                </p>
                <p id="ans-four">
                </p>To install solar panels find a qualified professional who has the certification to do 
                so, an industry-stand certification is received through the North American Board of Certified Energy
                Practitioners (NABCEP). Your installer will work with you to find the appropriate size for your system 
                and work with your energy needs. Your roof must be compatible with solar panels, and if necessary, a new 
                roof may be needed. Before installing your solar panels, you would need permits from your locality.

                <p id="q-five">How can I monitor the performance of my renewable energy system?
                 </p>
                <p id="ans-five">To monitor the performance of renewable energy systems through 
                        meters and other instruments. These instruments allow you to track the 
                        systemâ€™s battery voltage, the amount of power you are consuming, the level 
                        at which the battery is charged, etc.

                <p id="q-six">What kind of maintenance is required for residential wind turbines? 
                </p>
                <p id="ans-six">For maintenance you should check with your installer. Annual maintenance includes 
                        checking and tightening bolts and electrical connections, checking machines for corrosion 
                        and guy wires for proper tension. Replace worn or old edge tape on the turbine blades and 
                        replace components such as turbine blades or bearings. Many installers usually provide 
                        programs for maintenance.

                <p id="q-seven">How reliable are renewable energy systems in different weather conditions?
                </p>
                <p id="ans-seven">Renewable energy systems are reliable in adverse weather conditions, even 
                        during night when there is no sunlight for solar energy systems and where there is no 
                        wind for your wind turbines. Battery storage stores power from renewable energy sources 
                        and delivers it to the grid when that energy is needed, guaranteeing energy during adverse 
                        weather conditions.
