                                    According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, in 2022, the price of 
                                    renewable sources of energy such as solar photovoltaic energy costs <span style="color:#8ed973;">
                                    $0.0636 per kWh</span>, while fossil fuels costs <span style="color:#8ed973;">$0.2691 per kWh.</span>
                                     Through the years, the cost of renewable energy is drastically dropping. Also, investing in renewable energy allows 
                                    for various benefits without any external costs, unlike non-renewable energy, which 
                                    could cause environmental damage, property damage, and health problems.

                                    To install solar panels, find a qualified professional who has the certification to do so, such as an industry-stand 
                                    certification, which is received through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). Your 
                                    installer will work with you to find the appropriate size for your system and work with your energy needs.
                                    Your roof must be compatible with solar panels, and if necessary, a new roof may be needed. Before installing 
                                    your solar panels, you would need permits from your locality.

                                    and deliver it to the grid when that energy is needed, guaranteeing energy during adverse weather conditions.
